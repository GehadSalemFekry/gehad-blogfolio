Two years ago, I started applying for funded summer research programs abroad. At the time, I thought it would be nearly impossible to get accepted into one. But the more programs I discovered, the more I realized: *Why not?* Applying widely increases your chances, and you never know who might see potential in your profile.

While my primary interest lies in quantum computing, I found many opportunities in computer science, mathematics, and related fields that include quantum research as one of their domains. In this article, I’ll share some of the research programs I’ve come across—all with deadlines in the next two weeks.

  **A Quick Note:** Deadlines are often tied to specific time zones, so double-check the exact hour. To avoid last-minute technical issues, aim to submit your application a day or two early. Also, if recommendations are required, make sure to handle that well in advance.

When I was applying, I found it helpful to organize everything using Notion databases. I’ve included all these programs (and more) in a structured Notion database. You can clone it, add a status column, and track your applications easily. Check it out here: [Research Opportunities for Internationals](https://affiliate.notion.so/research-opportunities-for-internationals).

Now, let’s dive into the opportunities!
