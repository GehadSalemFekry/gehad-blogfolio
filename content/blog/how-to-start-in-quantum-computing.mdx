I want to start by sharing my story of how I first discovered quantum computing.

Back in high school, I was really interested in physicsâ€”especially when I was preparing for the Physics Olympiad. Thatâ€™s when I first learned about modern physics, and I completely fell in love with it.

But when I entered university and started studying computer science, physics gradually faded into the background. I wasnâ€™t actively thinking about it anymore. Then, completely by chance, I stumbled upon the **Qubit by Qubit** program and discovered something called "quantum computing."

Like any person with a fear of missing out, I applied without thinking much about itâ€”and then promptly forgot about it. Some time later, I got an email saying I had been accepted into the program with a full scholarship for a one-year course on quantum computing.

Honestly, it wasnâ€™t something I had planned for, but I figured Iâ€™d give it a shot.

As I worked through the program, my curiosity started to grow. The idea of quantum computing felt fresh, new, and differentâ€”almost like an undiscovered treasure that not many people were paying attention to. That intrigued me.

I ended up watching **almost every** introductory video on quantum phenomena I could find, and the **physics behind it blew my mind**. It was unlike anything I had studied before, and I got completely hooked. That was back in 2021.

### Discovering the Bigger Picture in Quantum  

The following summer (2022), I was trying to explore every possible opportunity in quantum computing. Thatâ€™s when I realized that **quantum is so much more than just computing**. Itâ€™s a whole world of different research areas, including:
- Quantum Algorithms
- Quantum Annealing
- Quantum Error Mitigation (Correction)
- Quantum Complexity Theory
- Quantum Foundations
- Quantum Information Theory  
- ...and so much more!  

Thatâ€™s why I wanted to write this postâ€”to **help you get started** on your own learning journey  by sharing some of the resources and insights that helped me along the way. ðŸš€

# How to Start Learning Quantum Computing  

## Step 1: Get a Feel for Quantum Physics (Without Going Too Deep Yet)  

If you know nothing about quantum physics or quantum computing, start with fun, animated YouTube videos that introduce the basic quantum phenomena intuitively. These videos are not super technical, but they will give you the **right mindset and intuition** to understand whatâ€™s happening at a high level.

- Beginner-friendly playlist: [Quantum Physics by Up and Atom](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL1lNrW4e0G8WmWpW846oE_m92nw3rlOpz)  
- More advanced but still intuitive: [Quantum Mechanics by PBS Space Time](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLsPUh22kYmNCGaVGuGfKfJl-6RdHiCjo1)  

ðŸ“Œ **No need to memorize everything!** Just enjoy the science and get a feel for the weirdness of quantum mechanics.


## Step 2: Decide Your Path â€“ Physics or Theory?  

Once youâ€™ve got the basics, you can **choose how you want to continue** based on your interests.

### Option 1: Quantum Hardware & Physics (Experimental Path) 

If youâ€™re more into the physical sideâ€”how quantum computers actually work and the physics behind themâ€”this course is a great structured way to learn:

ðŸ“š Quantum Physics Course on Coursera: [Exploring Quantum Physics](https://www.coursera.org/learn/quantum-physics)

Iâ€™m actually following along with this course right now because I wanted a proper university-like learning experience in quantum mechanics. Since my background is mostly software, I wanted something that fills the physics gaps in my knowledge.

The problem with many university lecture recordings on YouTube is that they are low-quality classroom recordings, which I personally find distracting. Thatâ€™s why I looked for an alternative with a good learning environment, structured lessons, and interactive content. On Coursera, you can audit the course for free or apply for financial aid if you want full access.

### Option 2: Quantum Information & Theory (CS Path)

If you come from a computer science background (like me) and want to explore quantum from a theoretical and computational perspective, I highly recommend:

ðŸ”¹ IBMâ€™s Qiskit Learning Platform: [Basics of Quantum Information](https://learning.quantum.ibm.com/course/basics-of-quantum-information)

Whatâ€™s great about this is that it combines video explanations with hands-on coding tutorials, making it perfect for programmers.  


## Step 3: Learn Both in Parallel  

You donâ€™t need to master physics before touching quantum circuits. The two can be learned side by side. Thatâ€™s why I recommend starting with the YouTube videos, then picking either the physics or quantum information path depending on your interest.

ðŸ“Œ **Physics helps with intuition**, but you can understand quantum computing concepts even without deep physics knowledge.

# Extra Tips for Staying Motivated  

### 1. Engage in Online Opportunities & Hackathons
Self-studying quantum can be lonely and distracting, so try to join online programs and hackathons. These keep you motivated and give you a reason to keep learning.

Some quantum opportunities are listed in my [Quantum Opportunities article](http://gehadsalem.tech/blog/exploring-quantum-computing-opportunities).


### 2. Join Quantum Communities
Networking is crucial! Being part of an active community can help you **learn, ask questions, and stay inspired**. I highly recommend:

ðŸ’¬ [QWorld Discord](https://discord.gg/Ay96wbmuFZ) â€“ Great place for discussions, connecting with others in the quantum community, and staying updated on QWorld's latest activities, workshops, and learning opportunities.

ðŸ’¬ [PennyLane Discord](https://discord.gg/WEEeSSAc2w) â€“ If youâ€™re into quantum machine learning.

Many online courses and programs also have **dedicated Discord servers**, so make sure to join those when you enroll.


### 3. Read University Lecture Notes (Theyâ€™re Gold!)
One of my favorite ways to learn is through lecture notes from professors. Each professor has their own unique style, and combining insights from different notes can give you a much richer perspective. 
ðŸ“š **My Top Picks:**  

[Prof. Scott Aaronson's Lecture Notes](https://www.scottaaronson.com/qclec.pdf) (Quantum Computing & Information) 

Prof. Scott Aaronson is one of my favorite professors when it comes to quantum computing. His lecture notes are easy to follow, highly engaging, and even entertaining at times. He has a very unique writing style that keeps you interestedâ€”you wonâ€™t get bored reading them! Some parts are even amusing, making complex topics fun to explore. If youâ€™re looking for a resource that explains quantum computing in a way thatâ€™s both rigorous and enjoyable, this is it.

[Dr. Saeed Mehrabanâ€™s Course at TUFTS](https://www.cs.tufts.edu/comp/150QCS/#material) â€“ Lecture Notes + Optional Readings

What I really love about these notes is that they include optional readings from books and research papers, which provide deeper insights into the topics covered. If you're the type of person who enjoys diving into theoretical and research-oriented material, this is a fantastic resource to check out.

These lecture notes are amazing supplements to structured courses or self-study. You donâ€™t have to go through everything, just pick topics youâ€™re interested in and explore at your own pace! ðŸš€

# Final Thoughts  

If youâ€™re just starting out in quantum computing, donâ€™t stress about understanding everything at once. Itâ€™s a complex but fascinating field, and the key is to stay curious and explore at your own pace.

Most importantlyâ€”have fun learning! Quantum computing is still in its early days, so youâ€™re getting in at an exciting time.
