Quantum computing is rapidly evolving, and as someone passionate about the field, I‚Äôve noticed a growing number of opportunities that make quantum education more accessible. Whether you‚Äôre a student, researcher, or simply curious about quantum, there are many programs, hackathons, and mentorships to help you dive deeper into this fascinating domain.

In this article, I‚Äôve compiled a list of recurring quantum education programs and events. These opportunities happen every year (or almost every year), so you can keep them on your radar. If you know of others, I‚Äôd love to hear from you in the comments! üòä

## [IBM Quantum](https://www.linkedin.com/showcase/ibm-quantum) & [Qiskit](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qiskit) Programs

IBM and Qiskit have been doing amazing work to educate people about quantum computing. They‚Äôve created a range of accessible programs that works to all levels of expertise. Here are some of their recurring opportunities:

- **IBM Quantum Challenge**: A **bi-annual global event**, typically held in Spring and Fall, where participants tackle real-world quantum challenges. It‚Äôs a great way to push your skills and test your quantum knowledge. You can find the resources for the most recent challenge [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/ibm-quantum-challenge-2024).
- **Qiskit Global Summer School**: This is a **two-week summer intensive** focusing on advanced quantum topics. Even if you miss the live program, the recordings and resources are always made available online. You can access the resources for the most recent summer school [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/qgss-2024).
- **IBM Qiskit Explorers**: A self-paced program that usually runs from August to February. It‚Äôs designed to guide learners through milestones with short quizzes at each step. While this program wasn‚Äôt held this year, it‚Äôs definitely worth keeping an eye on for updates. The collection of resources from last year‚Äôs program is an absolute gem‚Äîyou can find it [here](https://github.com/qiskit-community/quantum-explorers). Highly recommended for anyone wanting a structured way to dive into quantum topics!

## [WOMANIUM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/womanium) Quantum Program

This program holds a special place in my journey because it truly helped me grow. üíú It‚Äôs a **3-month summer program** that‚Äôs packed with a lot of learning and hands-on experiences. Throughout the program, you‚Äôll explore various quantum topics, and at the end, there‚Äôs a hackathon where you get to solve real-world challenges provided by different companies.

If you‚Äôre looking for a program that combines education with practical application, this is one program I highly recommend!

## [QWorld](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qworld19) Programs

QWorld is a global initiative with a strong focus on quantum education, and they‚Äôve built an incredible network of communities called QCousins all around the world, like [QEgypt](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qegypt) üåç. Here are some of the important programs by QWorld:

- **QIntern**: This is a summer program where you get the chance to work on quantum-related projects (mostly research, but not always) and present your work at the end. It‚Äôs a great way to dive into real-world quantum problems while collaborating with others.
- **QClass and QCourse**: These are year-long programs that run from September to May. QClass is at the undergraduate level, while QCourse dives deeper for those at the graduate level.

QWorld also offers short-term programs for different learning levels:
- **QPrep**: Python programming and linear algebra basics.
- **QBronze**: An introduction to quantum computing.
- **QSilver**: Intermediate-level content focusing on quantum Fourier transform (QFT) and Shor‚Äôs algorithm.
- **QCobalt**: Quantum annealing.
- **QNickel**: Oracle-based quantum algorithms.

These programs make it easier to find something that fits your skill level, whether you‚Äôre just starting out or looking to dig deeper.

## [The Coding School](https://www.linkedin.com/school/the-coding-school) ‚Äì Qubit by Qubit

This yearly course is designed for high schoolers and freshmen to dive into the basics of quantum computing. It‚Äôs a great introduction, and I have a personal connection to this one‚ÄîI attended as a student four years ago, and this year, I returned as a TA! Seeing the next generation get excited about quantum is always inspiring.

## [Quantum Open Source Foundation (QOSF)](https://www.linkedin.com/company/qosf)

The **QOSF Mentorship Program** is another fantastic opportunity, especially for those interested in research. It runs in two cohorts each year (March‚ÄìJune and October‚ÄìJanuary).

What‚Äôs really cool about this program is that even if you don‚Äôt get selected, the **application process itself is a great learning experience**. I applied for the most recent cohort and, although I wasn‚Äôt selected, I gained so much from working on a quantum annealing challenge. It was my first time exploring quantum annealing deeply, and it‚Äôs a journey I‚Äôd recommend to anyone.

## Hackathons

Hackathons are some of the most exciting and interactive ways to explore quantum computing. Here are a couple of my favorite recurring ones:

- **iQuHACK**: This hackathon is organized by [MIT iQuISE](https://www.linkedin.com/company/iquise) and is open for both in-person (at MIT) and online participation. It‚Äôs a great opportunity to collaborate and innovate with others.
- **Blaise Pascal Quantum Challenge**: This is an exciting hackathon/challenge organized by [Pasqal](https://www.linkedin.com/company/pasqal) that brings together quantum computing and AI to tackle **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**. 
The current hackathon is **open now**, offering a chance to win ‚Ç¨30,000 in prizes, with a deadline of January 30. 
You can join using your university email [here](https://bit.ly/42cLpIr), and for more details, check out [this post about it](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/gehad-salem_agorize-activity-7284941400486387713-I-8O). Don‚Äôt miss out‚Äîthis is a fantastic opportunity to explore quantum and AI while tackling meaningful global challenges!
