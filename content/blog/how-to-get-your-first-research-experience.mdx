How do I get my first research experience? 
I get this question a lot, it feels like a paradox—everyone asks for experience, but how are you supposed to gain it if you’re just starting out?

For me, it started with hackathons. Most computer science hackathons focus on building apps or software, but some dive into niche topics. My niche? **Quantum computing**.  

Three years ago, I joined the **[WOMANIUM](https://www.linkedin.com/company/womanium) program**—a 3-month course in quantum computing and hardware. 
(By the way, all their recordings are available on their [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@womanium) if you’re interested!).

The program ended with a hackathon. Back then, my background in quantum computing wasn’t very strong, but I saw it as an opportunity to learn. That’s where I realized hackathons can be more than coding—they can be a hands-on way to explore research topics. 

## Other Ways to Get Started

Start **reading research papers** in your field. I know, it can feel overwhelming at first. My advice? Start with the abstracts. Once you get a feel for the terminology, pick a paper that stands out to you and dive in. If something doesn’t make sense (and it probably won’t at first), don’t be discouraged. Use online resources or forums to look things up. Over time, you’ll get more familiar with the concepts and gain confidence.

Don’t be afraid to **reach out to your university professors**! Most are happy to help if you’re genuinely interested. Before reaching out, do some research on what they’re working on and think about how your interests align. That way, if they ask what you want to do, you’ll have something prepared. Trust me, professors appreciate curiosity and effort.

## Final Thoughts

Getting your first research experience isn’t easy, but taking small steps—joining hackathons, reading papers, or simply asking for guidance—can open doors.

Remember, every expert started as a beginner! You’ve got this.
