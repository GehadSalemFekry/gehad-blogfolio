Hello everyone! I’m Gehad Salem, a computer science student and quantum computing enthusiast. I had the opportunity to participate in the Summer@EPFL program, and given the numerous DMs and questions I’ve received about the application process, I decided to put together this guide. If you have more questions after reading, don't hesitate to drop them in the comments—I’ll keep updating this article with answers to help you out!

## Application Process Overview

The application for the Summer@EPFL program usually opens in November each year, with a deadline on the first Sunday of December at 11:59 PM AoE (that’s "Anywhere on Earth" time). You can find all the details and start your application on their official site: [Summer@EPFL](https://summer.epfl.ch/).

## What You’ll Need for the Application

- **Transcripts**: A high GPA is important. Based on my own experience and that of friends who were admitted, they had a high GPA (probably 3.9 or higher).
  
- **Motivation Letter**: When writing your motivation letter, it's important to highlight your research experience. By research experience, I mean any active participation in a research setting, not necessarily having publications (though that’s a big plus if you do). Describe your involvement in research projects, your engagement with academic literature, and any attempts to develop new findings. Also, highlight any coursework that is directly related to the lab you are interested in. If any courses included a research component or required you to produce a research paper, make sure to mention these in your letter.

- **CV**: Your CV should highlight your academic, professional, and research achievements. Be sure to include any relevant experiences, workshops, hackathons, competitions, or projects, especially those that align with the interests of the labs you're interested in.

## Choosing Your Lab Preferences

One important part of your application is specifying your top three lab preferences. But how do you decide which labs might be the best fit for you?

A great starting point is to explore the research domains at EPFL: [EPFL Research Domains](https://www.epfl.ch/schools/ic/research/domains/). Take the time to review the recent publications of each professor to get a feel for the work conducted in their labs. Although you will likely work more closely with a PhD student or postdoc rather than the professor himself, understanding the lab's general research focus is important for tailoring your motivation letter accordingly.

When choosing your domain and professor, it’s wise to think strategically. Highly popular fields like machine learning often attract a large number of applicants, making them highly competitive. To enhance your chances, consider exploring areas that are less hyped but still interest you. 

If you are considering machine learning, try also exploring professors in other labs who might be applying ML techniques under the umbrella of another field. This can be less competitive while still aligning with your area of interest.

For me, when I was applying, I was interested in quantum computing and theoretical computer science, so I found a professor working in post-quantum cryptography—and I got interested in the work. This is a very specific topic, and my motivation letter was oriented towards it, which I think aligned well with one of the postdocs in the lab, improving my chances of getting accepted.

## Evaluation and Interview Process

After you submit your application, all forms are evaluated and filtered through the IC School (Informatique et Communications in French), also known as the School of Computer and Communication Sciences in English, at EPFL. Applications that meet the criteria are then forwarded to the respective labs, which choose candidates they want to interview or assess further.

This interview or assessment mainly depends on the person who, if you're accepted, will be supervising your work in the lab. If it's an interview, a general tip is to thoroughly review the research interests of that person and his or her publications. Try to read through the abstracts of these papers to get a sense of their work and to be better prepared for the interview, anticipating potential discussion points. Additionally, you might find it helpful to look on LinkedIn to see if anyone has interned under this person's supervision before. This can give you insights into the assessment or interview style and how to prepare further.

Interviews are usually conducted from the end of December until mid-January, with the final decision on acceptance or rejection available by the end of January.
